<h3>KD/A Scatter Plot</h3>
<div id="radio_scatter" class="center_plot">
        <input type="radio" id="scatter_t1" name="region" value="Cloud9">
        <label for="Cloud9">Cloud9</label>
        <input type="radio" id="scatter_t2" name="region" value="Vision Strikers">
        <label for="Vision Strikers">Vision Strikers</label>
        <input type="radio" id="scatter_t3" name="region" value="OpTic Gaming">
        <label for="OpTic Gaming">OpTic Gaming</label>

</div>

<div id="scatter">

    </div>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="scatter_plot" class="center_plot">
    </div>

</div>
    
</div>
<p>
    This is a scatter plot with each dot representing each players. 
    The main purpose of this graph was to answer "Which player has the highest kda", and it is kind of obvious to check.
    <br>
    However, if you press the button on top, which are the three teams that 
    I was interested in, you can see the team's specific players. For instance, it was interesting to see Vision Striker to have 
    players with a big difference of kda, but I found out that Lakia (the player with lower kda) plays supporting character, which is a 
    character that is hard to get kills. This is also little bit different from my original proposal, but I fixed it for my own interest.

<h3>Average Combat Score Per Map</h3>

      
<div id="bar">   

    </div>  
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="bar_plot" class="center_plot">
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>
    <body>
            As mentioned in the proposal, this is a bar graph comparing ACS (average combat score) for each map. 
        I used columns ACS, and map. 
        This graph answers the question of "Does a certain map makes ACS to drop?", meaning that is there
        any map that are harder to play. <br>
        Furthermore, animation of bar graph is added because flipping and changing color is not an animation as 
        the gradescope regrade suggested. This particular animation is a graph entering one by one.

<h3>Team K/D/A Graph</h3>

<div id="stacked_bar">

    </div>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="stacked_bar_plot" class="center_plot">
    </div>
</div>    
<p>
    This is stacked bar graph answering the question "What is Team's average kda". I also changed this and wrote it down via gradescope.
    <br>
    If you hover over the graph, you can see the average kills of each team. Notice that average k, d, a differs a lot because 
    some teams had more matches. This made me thought of making standardized version of the graph.

<div>
<h3>Player Numbers For Different Regions</h3>

<div id="choropleth">
    </div>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="choropleth_graph" class="center_plot">
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    This is choropleth with blue dots representing players in that country. If the circle is bigger, that means there are more players 
    from that country. I can see that there are lots of players from North and South America. 
    <br>
    I can zoom in through the map using the mouse to anywhere I want as well to see more carefully. 

</p>

<h3>Network Tree for Famous Teams</h3>

<div id="network">
    </div>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="network_graph" class="center_plot">
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    This is a network with top 5 team as the node. The line represents the relationship between teams for the 
    average kda and assists.
